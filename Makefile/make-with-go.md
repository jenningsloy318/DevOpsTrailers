Automating Go development with Make

From https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/make/


[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is an old tool that you can use today to help get everyone on your team on the same page, and make it easy for new contributors to your project to get started. In some cases Make can help you avoid unnecessary work! Let’s see how you can integrate Make into your development workflow.

For this example, we are going to pretend our application uses [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to send data back and forth. Protocol buffers, or protobufs for short, are a data serialization format that let you declare the same information in a lot fewer bytes than JSON. Protobufs are the inspiration for the [<font color=red>encoding/gob</font> package](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/).

To use protobufs, first we declare a .proto file containing all of the objects we might send over the wire. (Here’s what a real protobuf file looks like.) Our application is pretty simple.

app.proto
```
syntax = "proto3";

package app;

message User {
    int64 id = 1;
    string email = 2;
    string name = 3;
}
```
To use this in an application, we generate a language-specific protobuf file, using the protobuf compiler <font color=red>`protoc`</font>. To compile the Go protobuf file, we need <font color=red>`protoc`</font> and the Go specific extension, protoc-gen-go. (We’ll walk through how to get those in a bit). Then we run:
```
protoc --go_out=. app.proto
```
This will generate a Go file called app.pb.go that’s about a hundred lines long, with some helpers for accessing properties on the struct. Here’s a sample:

app.pb.go
```
type User struct {
	Id    int64  `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=id" json:"id,omitempty"`
	Email string `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=email" json:"email,omitempty"`
	Name  string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=name" json:"name,omitempty"`
}

func (m *User) GetId() int64 {
	if m != nil {
		return m.Id
	}
	return 0
}
```
In a large application, the  <font color=red>`protoc`</font> command is likely to be a lot longer. When something is long and potentially hard to remember, members of your team may remember and run different invocations of the command. This can lead to problems, so you introduce a Makefile with a single target,  <font color=red>`compile`</font>, that runs the above command.

The advantage of using a Makefile (versus <font color=red>`rake, grunt, robo`</font>, or any other automation tools) is that Make comes preinstalled on pretty much every Unix machine, so you don’t need any dependencies to run it. You can use Make no matter what language your code is written in, so your organization can standardize on <font color=red>`make test`</font> to run tests and <font color=red>`make serve`</font> to start a development server on every project at your company, regardless of the language it’s written in. <font color=red>`make`</font> is also very fast; <font color=red>`make`</font> can print the version string (or e.g. start running commands) in about ten milliseconds, where Grunt or other tools written in interpreted languages can take about 300ms before they start doing anything. If your test suite only takes 10 milliseconds to run, you don’t want your build tool increasing the time it takes to run tests by 30x.

**Makefile**
```
.PHONY: compile

compile:
	protoc --go_out=. app.proto
```

So you add a Makefile, tell everyone on your team to forget about the long <font color=red>`protoc`</font> invocation and just run <font color=red>`make compile`</font> instead. Everyone standardizes on the same command, you can update the run command and ensure everyone is instantly using it, and things are good.

But we can do better! At the heart of  <font color=red>`make`</font> is a dependency graph:  <font color=red>`make`</font> assembles targets from various inputs. The key insight is that if the inputs haven’t changed, you don’t have to regenerate the output. In our example, if we run  <font color=red>`make compile`</font>  but  <font color=red>`app.proto`</font> hasn’t changed, we don’t need to regenerate  <font color=red>`app.pb.go`</font>, since we will (or should, at least) get the same result.

We have to rearrange our Makefile a bit. The left side of the colon is the target, the file being built. To the right of the colon, we list the various inputs that the target depends upon.

```
.PHONY: compile

app.pb.go: app.proto
	protoc --go_out=. app.proto

# This is a "phony" target - an alias for the above command, so "make compile"
# still works.
compile: app.pb.go
```
If Make determines the target file is newer than the inputs, it will decide there is nothing to do.
```
$ make app.pb.go
make: 'app.pb.go' is up to date.
```
This is especially useful when you need to compile a lot of things to get your application running, as it lets you skip a lot of unnecessary work.

But we can go further! The compile target also depends on <font color=red>`protoc`</font> and on the <font color=red>`protoc-gen-go`</font> helper. We can add these as dependencies as well. Since we only need them to exist on the filesystem, we don’t care if they are newer or older than the target, we add a pipe character in the declaration, and list them afterwards.
```
.PHONY: compile
PROTOC_GEN_GO := $(GOPATH)/bin/protoc-gen-go

# If $GOPATH/bin/protoc-gen-go does not exist, we'll run this command to install
# it.
$(PROTOC_GEN_GO):
	go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

app.pb.go: app.proto | $(PROTOC_GEN_GO)
	protoc --go_out=. app.proto

# This is a "phony" target - an alias for the above command, so "make compile"
# still works.
compile: app.pb.go
```
Now, the first time someone on a new computer runs <font color=red>`make compile`</font>, they’ll get this:
```
$ make compile
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
protoc --go_out=. app.proto
```
And the second time they edit app.proto and run <font color=red>`make compile`</font>, they’ll skip the install step:
```
$ make compile
protoc --go_out=. app.proto
```
That’s a really useful technique for automating installation of binaries that are necessary to run various build tasks.

We can use roughly the same technique to install the protoc binary. This is trickier since the command might change based on the machine we’re running on, so we need to call uname to get the machine type, and then branch the install command based on the machine.

If this seems like too much work, and it might be, you can just have your Make target exit with an error if protoc is not installed, or echo a message explaining to people how and where to get protoc.
```
.PHONY: compile
PROTOC_GEN_GO := $(GOPATH)/bin/protoc-gen-go
PROTOC := $(shell which protoc)
# If protoc isn't on the path, set it to a target that's never up to date, so
# the install command always runs.
ifeq ($(PROTOC),)
    PROTOC = must-rebuild
endif

# Figure out which machine we're running on.
UNAME := $(shell uname)

$(PROTOC):
# Run the right installation command for the operating system.
ifeq ($(UNAME), Darwin)
	brew install protobuf
endif
ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux)
	sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
endif
# You can add instructions for other operating systems here, or use different
# branching logic as appropriate.

# If $GOPATH/bin/protoc-gen-go does not exist, we'll run this command to install
# it.
$(PROTOC_GEN_GO):
	go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

app.pb.go: app.proto | $(PROTOC_GEN_GO) $(PROTOC)
	protoc --go_out=. app.proto

# This is a "phony" target - an alias for the above command, so "make compile"
# still works.
compile: app.pb.go
```
The other place I’ve found dependency management like this to be really useful is in restarting a development server. You may have a few different targets - Go files, assets that must be compiled into a binary, and Protobuf files, and want to make sure they’re all up to date before starting the server. However, if they haven’t changed, you don’t want to do the additional work.

```
compile: app.pb.go # see above

assets/bindata.go: $(shell find static/ templates/)
	# https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata
	go-bindata ./static ./templates

assets: assets/bindata.go

# This command will run any time a .go file in the current directory is newer
# than the compiled binary.
$(GOPATH)/bin/myserver: $(shell find . -name '*.go)
	go install ./cmd/myserver

serve: $(GOPATH)/bin/myserver compile assets
```
Specifying the server’s dependencies as upstream inputs should make your server restarts much faster, since you skip work you don’t need to do!

**Notes**

How does  <font color=red>`make`</font> determine whether the target needs to be updated? It checks the file mtime [(ModTime in a os.FileInfo)](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) of the target. If the target is newer than the mtimes of the inputs, there’s no need to run the command.

Using mtimes for this check has flaws. For one, I can change the mtime of a file without actually modifying it, which would lead  <font color=red>`make`</font> to do unnecessary work. The other is that clocks can drift on your machine, which would lead mtimes to suggest work should be done when it doesn’t really have to be done.

A better approach is to hash the contents of the inputs and the target, and only rerun the  <font color=red>`make`</font> target body if the hashes don’t line up. This is the approach taken by [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), a tool written by Google that builds on a lot of what Make does. Bazel has a steep learning curve and can have slow startup times for smaller projects; if you’re not using any sort of dependency-tracking tool, just adding a Makefile can get you about 80% of the benefits that Bazel does.

It’s also - in a piece of excellent news - the approach built in to test running and build compilation in Go 1.10. Go 1.10 uses [content-based hashing](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/internal/cache/cache.go) to figure out when it doesn’t need to recompile a package. It uses the same approach for tests - if you ran the tests and they passed, and the input files haven’t changed at all, you don’t need to rerun the tests. So when Go 1.10 gets released, you don’t need the  <font color=red>`$(GOPATH)/bin/myserver`</font> target in the Makefile above - you can always run  <font color=red>`go install ./...`</font> and it will exit immediately if there is no work to do!

Conclusion
You can use Make to automate the process of installing build tools that are ancillary to your build process, which should help open source projects or larger teams where contributors don’t necessarily need or want to know how to install those tools.

There are probably steps in your build process that you are running unnecessarily. Use Make (and Go 1.10) to avoid doing work you don’t need to, and get back that extra time!
