# HISTORY sets the number of prior password changes to keep and
# check for a user when changing passwords.  Setting the HISTORY
# value to zero (0), or removing/commenting out the flag will
# cause all users' prior password history to be discarded at the
# next password change by any user.  No password history will
# be checked if the flag is not present or has zero value.
# The maximum value of HISTORY is 26.
#
# This flag is only enforced for user accounts defined in the
# local passwd(4)/shadow(4) files.
